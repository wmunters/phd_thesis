\chapter{Optimal coordinated yaw control of wind farms}\label{ch:opt_yaw}

\def\mystrut{\rule{0pt}{1.1\normalbaselineskip}}

The current chapter investigates optimal coordinated yaw control in wind farms. In Chapter \ref{ch:introduction}, the concept of redirecting wakes using a steady and intentional yaw misalignment in upstream turbines was already introduced, and the prevalence of research on the characterization and exploitation of wake behavior behind turbines in steady yaw was shown. The application of dynamic optimal yaw control in the current chapter however allows to assess whether unsteady yaw behavior can yield improvements in power production due to benign interactions with the flow field. To the best knowledge of the author, this is the first time that this possibility is investigated. Furthermore, the potential of combining dynamic yaw control with dynamic induction control is examined. Control studies are performed for a wind farm of 16 turbines layed out in a $4 \times 4$ aligned pattern, both for a uniform inflow and a turbulent boundary layer inflow. 

The outline of the chapter is as follows. Section \ref{sec:opt_yaw_setup} describes the simulation cases, and details numeral setup parameters. Thereafter, Section \ref{sec:opt_yaw_results} presents optimization results for both uniform and turbulent inflow, and identifies distinct yaw control regimes resulting in increased power extraction. Concluding, Section \ref{sec:opt_yaw_concl} summarizes the main findings of the current chapter. 


\section{Numerical setup and case description}\label{sec:opt_yaw_setup}
This section discusses the simulation cases and setup details that will be used to assess the potential of dynamic yaw control. A wind farm of 16 wind turbines with a rotor diameter $D = 100$ m is considered. The turbines are arranged in a $4 \times 4$ aligned pattern, with $6D$ spacing in both axial and transversal directions. Firstly, numerical setup parameters for the simulation and optimization are discussed. Afterwards, the different control cases are introduced. 

\subsubsection{Simulation setup}
The simulation domain has a total dimension of $4.8 \times 2.4 \times 1 $ km$^3$, and is discretized on a grid of $256 \times 128 \times 128$ gridpoints. The final $10\%$ of the streamwise extent of the domain is used as a fringe region to impose inflow conditions. All cases apply periodic boundary conditions on transversal domain boundaries. 

Two different sets of simulations are considered. The first set is subjected to a laminar, steady and uniform inflow with $U_\infty = 8$ m s$^{-1}$. In this case, the top and bottom boundaries are treated with a symmetry condition, and the turbines are placed at the vertical mid-plane $z_h/H = 0.5$ to minimize any influence of vertical domain boundaries. The second set applies unsteady turbulent inflow conditions, which are generated in a pressure-driven precursor simulation of an unperturbed turbulent boundary layer driven by a pressure gradient of $\partial_x p_\infty/\rho = 2.5 \times 10^{-4}$ m s$^{-2}$ with shifted periodic boundary conditions, similar to the induction cases in Chapter \ref{ch:opt_induction}. In this second case, the top boundary is treated with a stress-free condition, and a high-Reynolds number wall model is used at the bottom. The turbines are placed at a height of $z_h/H = 0.1$ from the wall. The wall model adds a wall stress consistent with a rough-wall logarithmic boundary layer profile with $z_0/H = 10^{-4}$, resulting in a inflow turbulence intensity of about 8\% at hub height. 

The optimization is performed over 6 time windows with length $T_A = 150$ s, each of which employs a prediction horizon $T = 2T_A = 300$ s, leading to a total control time of 900 s. All time-averaged results shown below are based on statistics gathered after 300 s to compensate for the wake propagation time lag at startup. To limit computational efforts, we perform a fixed amount of 80 L-BFGS-B iterations in each window, corresponding to approximately 160 PDE simulations (forward or adjoint). Although formal convergence is not achieved for any of the cases after this amount of iterations, it will be shown later that, after this amount of iterations, the relative ordering of the cases based on power extraction is clear. Computational costs amount to approximately 35 000 corehours per optimization case for all 6 time windows combined  on Intel Broadwell architecture CPUs. The initial guess for the optimal controls within each window is a steady thrust coefficient setpoint $C_T'=2$  and yaw rate $\omega = 0^\circ$ s$^{-1}$ for all turbines. Simulation and optimization parameters are summarized below in Table \ref{tab:case_definition}.

Simulations are initialized as follows: for the turbulent inflow case, a fully-developed high-Reynolds number turbulent boundary layer is generated in the precursor inflow simulation by simulating a perturbed logarithmic flow until a statistically stationary state is achieved. For both the turbulent and the uniform inflow cases the main wind-farm simulation is then advanced in time with the proper inflow conditions until the effects of any wind-farm start-up transiens have subsided. These statistically stationary wind-farm flows then serve as initial conditions for the control cases defined below. Planviews at hub height of these initial conditions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:initial_conditions_flow_yaw}. It can be seen from the Figure \ref{fig:initial_conditions_flow_yaw}a that, given laminar inflow conditions, turbine wakes are very deep and remain stable up until row 3, after which meandering and vortex shedding starts to occur. These flow conditions can be regarded as somewhat articifial since, in the atmospheric boundary layer, background turbulence typically causes instant wake transition behind the turbine rotor. Nevertheless, this setup allows us to investigate control dynamics more easily, as we can rule out any reaction of the optimization to the background variability. Furthermore, suppressed wake meandering and reduced turbulence levels have been known to occur in wind farms submerged in stably stratified atmospheric boundary layers \cite{larsen2009dependence, machefaux2016experimental}, hence rendering the current case relevant for such situations. Figure \ref{fig:initial_conditions_flow_yaw}b contrastingly shows that, for the turbulent inflow case, the background turbulence causes wake instabilities instantly, leading to enhanced wake recovery and much more complex unsteady wake interactions between turbines.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Control cases}

For each set of simulations, we consider a steady reference case (R) with $C_T' = 2$ and $\omega = 0^\circ$/s. Further, we define a first yaw control case (Y), with a steady $C_T'=2$, but turbines are allowed to yaw dynamically at a maximum rate of $\omega^{\text{max}} = 0.3^\circ$/s, corresponding to the maximum yaw rate of the conceptual NREL 5MW and the DOWEC 6MW turbines \citep{jonkman2009definition, kooijman2003dowec}. In addition, a second yaw control case (Y5) is defined, for which a higher maximum yaw rate of $\omega^{\text{max}} = 5^\circ$/s is selected. Although this significantly exceeds the capabilities of the abovementioned turbine design concepts, this case will allows to assess whether significant gains in power could be achieved by rapidly yawing turbine designs, such as low-inertia two-bladed teeter hinge wind turbines \citep{kim2014yaw}. 

Also, two induction control cases are considered, in which turbines can adapt their thrust coefficient $C_T'$ with a characteristic timescale $\tau = 5$ s: an underinductive case (I2, with $\ctmax = 2$), and an overinductive case (I3, with $\ctmax = 3$). Finally, for both the latter cases, also the option of combining dynamic induction control with the yaw control of case Y is considered, defining the induction-yawing cases I2Y and I3Y respectively. The cases investigated in this study are summarized in Table \ref{tab:case_definition}.

\section{Results \& discussion}\label{sec:opt_yaw_results}
The current section presents and discusses the results of the optimal control cases. Firstly, the convergence behavior is illustrated for a typical optimization window, justifying the optimization parameters discussed in previous section. Thereafter, Section \ref{sec:opt_yaw_uniform} and \ref{sec:opt_yaw_turb} present the results of the uniform and turbulent inflow cases respectively. Concluding, Section \ref{sec:opt_yaw_disc} compares both simulation sets and identifies the most promising control approaches.

Figure \ref{fig:convergence} illustrates the typical convergence behavior within an optimization window for the uniform inflow case. Figure \ref{fig:convergence}a shows that, although formal convergence is not achieved for any of the cases, after 80 iterations, the relative ordering of the cases is clear and further improvements in the cost function for an increased amount of iterations are marginal. From Figure \ref{fig:convergence}b it can be seen that the amount of PDE evaluations (forward or adjoint) is approximately twice the amount of BFGS iterations, indicating that the optimizer mostly takes Newton steps without a further line search. Furthermore, similar to the behavior of the exclusively inductive cases from Chapter \ref{ch:opt_induction}, the strong increase in PDE evaluations for I3 and I2Y can be explained by the fact that the limits of continuous adjoint gradient accuracy complicate satisfaction of the Wolfe conditions upon approaching a (local) optimum. Similar characteristics were observed for the turbulent case (not further shown here).

\subsection{Uniform inflow}\label{sec:opt_yaw_uniform}

Figure \ref{fig:flowfield_uniform} depicts instantaneous planviews of velocity and vorticity at hub height at t = 450 s for the reference case R, yawing case Y, overinductive case I3, and combined case I3Y. A first qualitative comparison between the flow fields indicates that, for the given setup, case Y achieves more intense wake mixing, destabilization, and lateral spreading through reorientation of turbine thrust forces than the overinductive case I3, which attempts to increase mixing by shedding vortex rings. Furthermore, combined case I3Y shows a superposition of the aformentioned behavior, i.e. redirected wakes with periodically shed vortices. 

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

First, the yaw and power characteristics of the yaw-enabled control cases Y, Y5, I2Y, and I3Y are qualitatively discussed. Time evolution of yaw angles are shown, and two distinct yawing regimes are identified. Second, the induction characteristics of induction-enabled cases I2, I3, I2Y, and I3Y are shortly presented. Third, time-averaged power extraction and wind-farm efficiency are compared between cases. 

\subsubsection{A. Yaw characteristics}

Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_uniform} illustrates the time evolution of normalized power extraction and yaw angle of the optimal yawing cases (Y, Y5, I2Y, and I3Y), as defined in Table \ref{tab:case_definition}. 
The top panels of Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_uniform} show that, for all optimal yaw cases, power is curtailed to a limited extent in the first row, whereas power in downstream rows is increased significantly after a delay corresponding to the wake advection time.  
\begin{figure}
%	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapters/optimal_yaw_control/power_angle_ctfilt_lam.eps}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapters/optimal_yaw_control/power_yaw_lam.eps}	
	\caption{Time evolution of uniform inflow yaw-enabled cases. \emph{Top: } Turbine power extraction $P$, normalized by mean first row power in the uncontrolled reference $\overline{P}_{R1}^R$. \emph{Bottom: } Yaw angle $\theta$. Line colors indicate different turbine columns as indicated in Figure \ref{fig:initial_conditions_flow_yaw} ({\color{C1} C1}, {\color{C2} C2}, {\color{C3} C3}, {\color{C4} C4}), i.e. every line represents a single wind turbine. \label{fig:dynamic_uniform}}
\end{figure}

Turning to the time evolution of the yaw angle $\theta$, a first observation is that, although the 4 columns of the considered wind farm are statistically equivalent in the reference case, their behavior in an optimal control setting is heterogeneous. For example, for case Y, the first-row behavior of the yaw angle $\theta$ seems to exhibit a bifurcation between 2 limit cycles. On the one hand, the first-row turbines columns C1, C2, and C3 initially oscillate around the flow-aligned yaw angle of 0, triggering a \emph{wake meandering} type of motion. Column C4 on the other hand directly turns to a misaligned yaw angle of $30^\circ$, after which it shows some minor high frequency yaw oscillations. As shown in panel Y of Figure \ref{fig:flowfield_uniform}, the former wake meandering mechanism mainly acts on increased wake spreading in the lateral direction, and enhances recovery by increasing the contact area between the wake and its surroundings. Turbine row 2 and 3 oscillate show more complex oscillations, with additional variability in response to the unsteady incoming flow conditions. In contrast, the first-row yaw misalignment in column C4 creates a more shallow wake which is \emph{redirected} such that it just misses the downstream turbine. Downstream rows 2 and 3 exhibit some oscillations around a yaw misalignment angle of $\approx 17^\circ$, causing further yaw redirection downstream. Since there is no further downstream potential for wake mixing or redirection, the final row consistently shows a yaw angle aligned with the mean flow. Similar time evolutions of the yaw angle are observed for column C2 of combined yaw--induction case I2Y. In cases I3Y and Y5, the wake meandering regime seems to be virtually non-existent and wake redirection is dominant, except for the initial stage of the first-row turbine in column C2. In summary, two distinct and relatively simple mechanisms for power increase through yaw control are found: on the one hand a \emph{dynamic} wake meandering regime is identified, and on the other hand a \emph{static} wake redirection regime is observed. These mechanisms are further analyzed below.

\paragraph{Static yaw regime - wake redirection}
Figure \ref{fig:cross_section} shows cross sections of the time-averaged axial velocity field from case Y, taken at half a rotor diameter upstream of the downstream turbines of column C4, for which turbines directly go to static yaw angles of 30$^\circ$, 17$^\circ$, and 17$^\circ$ for the first, second, and third row respectively (see Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_uniform}). The figure illustrates that the yaw misalignment of upstream turbines causes the wake to be redirected away from the downstream ones. Moreover, as observed in recent studies, the wake induced by the yaw-misaligned upstream turbines has a curled shape with counter-rotating vortices at its top and bottom \citep{howland2016wake,bastankhah2016experimental}. The current LES-based flow model allows to directly account for this in developing the control strategies, as the wakes are curled just around the downstream turbines, resulting from a balance between limiting upstream power loss and redirecting the wakes sufficiently. The static yaw wake redirection regime observed in the optimal control simulations can be mimicked by imposing fixed yaw misalignments corresponding to the aforementioned values. This simplified control case, denoted as Ystat, will be used to compare the obtained power gains from optimal controls to simplified strategies further below. 
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapters/optimal_yaw_control/frontview_yaw.eps}
	\caption{Time-averaged cross-sectional views of axial velocity $u$ for case Y at a distance $D/2$ upstream of the downstream turbines in column C4. Arrows indicate represent the projection of the velocity vector on the cross-sectional plane. Dashed white lines indicate turbine rotor locations. \label{fig:cross_section}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Dynamic yaw regime - wake meandering}
Figure \ref{fig:spec_uniform} shows column-averaged power spectra of the yaw angle $\theta$. We focus on relatively slow dynamics: spectra are shown up to a non-dimensional Strouhal number of $St = f D/U_\infty = 0.8$, corresponding to variations with a time period higher than 15 s. The figure shows that, for the upstream rows 1 to 3, the variance of the fast yawing case Y5 is significantly higher than the slow yawing cases Y, I2Y, and I3Y. The first row of case Y shows a significant peak around a Strouhal number $St = f D/U_\infty= 0.2$, corresponding to the frequency of the aforementioned oscillations around aligned yaw angles, triggering wake meandering. Indeed, a Strouhal number in the range of 0.1 - 0.3 has been associated with natural wake meandering before in various studies \citep{medici2008measurements, howard2015statistics}. Although attenuated, this peak seems to manifest itself to a limited degree in downstream rows as well. Furthermore, traces of this behavior are also observed for case I2Y, for which it was already mentioned that the first row of column C2 showed behavior consistent with a regime triggering wake meandering. In contrast, as observed qualitatively from Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_uniform}, cases Y5 and I3Y show no strongly coherent dynamic yaw characteristics, indicating that static wake redirection yaw is dominant here. Similar to the simplified static yaw case derived from the wake redirection behavior in previous paragraph, the wake meandering regime can be approximated by imposing a simple bang-bang control on the first row turbines, alternating the yaw rate of the rotor in both directions with a frequency corresponding to a Strouhal number $St = 0.2$. The coherent dynamics and phase differences of the yaw rates in the downstream turbines are more complex. Therefore, these turbines not yawed in the derived control case. This simplified case is further denoted as Ymeander. 
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapters/optimal_yaw_control/PSD_laminar.eps}
	\caption{Row-averaged power spectral density estimate of yaw angle $\theta$ as a function of Strouhal number $St = f D/U_\infty$. Spectra of different rows are shifted vertically for clarity. Horizontal dashed lines indicate identical reference values for each row.\label{fig:spec_uniform}}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{B. Induction characteristics}
Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_ctfilt} illustrates the time evolution of normalized power extraction and thrust coefficient of the optimal induction cases (I2, I3, I2Y, and I3Y), as defined in Table \ref{tab:case_definition}. In contrast to the heterogeneous behavior in different columns for the yaw angles shown in Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_ctfilt} above, the induction coefficient behavior is similar for each column, and is illustrated for column C1 only. The top panels of Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_ctfilt} indicate that, for the exclusively inductive cases I2 and I3, first-row power is pulsed severely, leading to intermittent increases in downstream power extraction. This differs from the combined yaw-induction cases, which show much smoother power extraction dynamics. 
\begin{figure}
	%	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapters/optimal_yaw_control/power_angle_ctfilt_lam.eps}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapters/optimal_yaw_control/power_ctfilt_lam.eps}	
	\caption{Time evolution of column C1 in uniform inflow induction-enabled cases. \emph{Top: } Turbine power extraction $P$, normalized by mean first row power in the uncontrolled reference $\overline{P}_{R1}^R$. \emph{Bottom: } Thrust coefficient $\widehat{C}_T'$. \label{fig:dynamic_ctfilt}}
\end{figure}

Also the thrust coefficient dynamics vary significantly between different cases: the first-row thrust coefficients of I2 and I3 exhibit periodic oscillatory traits, and the downstream rows of these cases show somewhat more chaotic dynamics in response to unsteady flow conditions resulting from upstream actuation. Note that the period associated with this periodicity corresponds to the window length, i.e. 150 s, hence indicating that these cases are reacting to finite-horizon effects. 

The underinductive yawing case I2Y features only minor deviations from the reference and upper bound value of $\cthat = 2$, especially for $t > 200$ s. This can be explained based on the fact that, after this time, most turbines are yawed with respect to the incoming flow as shown in Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_uniform}, resulting in a lower axial velocity $V$, and hence a lower thrust force. Further reduction of this thrust force through lower thrust coefficients seem to show only very limited potential in increasing wind-farm power. 

A converse reasoning can be used to explain the induction characteristics in case I3Y: the higher mean values of $\cthat$ in rows 1, 2, and 3 indicate that the wind farm benefits from compensating for the thrust force reduction in yawed turbines by increasing their axial induction. Note that, for the exclusively overinductive case I3, the thrust coefficient in the same rows is slightly lower than 2. The last-row turbines of both overinductive cases (I3 and I3Y) are both aligned with the mean flow and show a similar slight increase in the mean thrust coefficient, indicating that the local flow conditions created by the upstream turbines cause the optimal thrust coefficient to be increased slightly. 

\subsubsection{C. Power extraction and wind-farm efficiency}

Figure \ref{fig:power_uniform} illustrates time-averaged wind-farm power results. Figure \ref{fig:power_uniform}a shows the row-averaged power extraction of the optimal control and reference cases, normalized by first-row power in the reference case $\overline{P}_{R1}^R$. It is shown that all cases curtail first-row power by about $10-20\%$ to the benefit of downstream rows. Furthermore, yaw-enabled cases Y, Y5, IY, and Ystat achieve an almost flat power curve among rows, and significantly outperform the exclusively inductive cases I2 and I3, for which modest gains are obtained only in rows 2 and 3 that perform poorly in the reference case.  

Figure \ref{fig:power_uniform}b depicts the wind farm efficiency, defined with respect to a situation in which all turbines extract the same power as a first-row reference case turbine, i.e. $\eta_{\text{farm}} = \overline{P}_{\text{farm}}/(N_t \overline{P}_{R1}^{R})$. As expected, the efficiency of the uncontrolled reference farm R is very low at around $40\%$. The inductive cases I2 and I3 manage to increase the efficiency to approximately 50\%. The standard yawing case Y attains an overall efficiency of about 77$\%$. Further, it can be seen that, under uniform inflow conditions, adding the possibility of fast yawing (case Y5) or underinduction (case I2Y) yields only a very minor increase in wind-farm efficiency. In contrast, the combined overinductive yaw control from case I3Y yields a significantly higher efficiency of about 84\%, indicating the potential for combining these control strategies under uniform inflow. 

Furthermore, also the efficiencies obtained by the simplified control approaches derived from the yaw characteristics in case Y are shown, i.e. the static yaw case Ystat and the dynamic yaw case Ymeander which triggers wake meandering. Interestingly, by simply applying on-off control at $St = 0.2$ for the first-row turbine as in Ymeander, a wind-farm efficiency of about 72\% can be attained.  Further, it can be seen that Ystat yields approximately the same wind-farm efficiency of 79\% as the optimally controlled yawing cases Y and Y5, suggesting that any dynamic effects observed for turbines in the wake redirection regime are of very minor importance. Furthermore, the fact that the expected value of Ystat is slightly higher than that of Y and Y5 can be attributed to the fact that optimizations are not fully converged, finite-horizon effects possibly have a small negative influence the optimal control cases, and the wake meandering regime that is present in some turbines for the optimal control cases yields slightly lower power than the pure wake redirection of Ystat.

\end{figure}

The current section showed results for the steady uniform inflow cases. All controlled cases increase wind-farm efficiency by a significant amount, with the yaw-enabled cases significantly outperforming cases based on induction control only. Given the current quiescent ambient flow conditions, simple yaw behavior was identified, i.e. dynamic yaw triggering wake meandering on one hand, and steady yaw resulting in wake redirection on the other hand. Moreover, the simplified control cases Ystat and Ymeander derived from this behavior attain similar wind-farm efficiencies than the optimal control cases. In the next section, unsteady and turbulent inflow conditions are applied, and it is investigated whether similar simplified control methods can be found.

\subsection{Turbulent inflow conditions}\label{sec:opt_yaw_turb}
DISCUSSION ON FLOW FIELDS

\end{figure}

Similar to the presentation of uniform inflow results in the previous section, firstly the yaw and power characteristics of the yaw-enabled control cases are described, after which the induction characteristics of inductive cases are shown. Finally,  power extraction and wind-farm efficiency are illustrated.

\end{figure}

In this section discussing the turbulent inflow cases, we will follow the same discussion as in previous section on uniform inflow. Again, Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_turb} shows power, yaw angle, and thrust coefficient for all cases, and Figure \ref{fig:flowfield_turb} depicts snapshots of the solution field at hub height at $t = 450$ s. Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_turb} indicates that both power and yaw angle exhibit significantly more variability compared to the uniform inflow set for all cases. Since wake meandering is already naturally triggered in turbulent boundary layers, the typical wake meandering regime with oscillations around yaw-aligned conditions is not observed for any of the cases here. In contrast, the yaw-enabled cases Y, Y5 and IY seem to turn to the wake redirection regime, characterized by approximately the same yaw angles as in the uniform inflow cases. Note however that there is significant response of the yaw angle to background variability in local flow conditions for all cases, even causing the yaw angle to flip signs temporarily. Similarly, the thrust coefficient signals of the axial induction control cases I and IY appear much more chaotic than in the uniform inflow set, and show no visually apparent signs of periodic repetitions in control signals.

Figure \ref{fig:power_turb} depicts time-averaged wind-farm power results in the same manner as Figure \ref{fig:power_uniform}. Again, Figure \ref{fig:power_turb}a shows that first-row power is being curtailed in all cases, ranging from $\approx 2\%$ in the case I to $10 - 16\%$ for the yawing cases, with power increasing in all downstream rows. Note that this curtailment is lower than in the uniform set, in which all cases curtail the first row with $\approx 20\%$. Note that the power of the reference case R, and its associated wind-farm efficiency $\eta_{\text{farm}}$ in Figure \ref{fig:power_turb}b, is significantly higher than in the uniform case due to natural wake transition and mixing even in the uncontrolled case. Further, the induction case I increases wind-farm effiency by 5$\%$-pts, which translates to a relative power increase of $9\%$ over the reference case, consistent with previously obtained results for a case with similar setup parameters \cite{munters2017optimal}. Efficiencies for the yaw-enabled case lie significantly higher with values above $70\%$. Note that, although the relative ordering of the optimized cases is preserved, the obtained efficiencies are lower than the corresponding ones for uniform inflow. This could be explained by the fact that redirecting turbine wakes is harder when ambient turbulence causes unsteady flow conditions at the rotor as well as chaotic wake deflection downstream. Further, in contrast to the laminar cases from previous section, the static yaw case Ystat is outperformed significantly by the dynamic optimal yawing cases Y, Y5, and IY. This can be explained by the fact that turbines not only aim to achieve deflection of downstream wakes, but also interact dynamically with the unsteadiness in the incoming flow.

\section{Summary} \label{sec:conc}
In this work, we investigate dynamic yaw control of wind farms for optimal power extraction. To this aim, we extended the optimal control framework OSP-Wind used in previous studies for dynamic axial induction control to include yaw. The potential of dynamic yaw control is evidenced based on a $4\times4$ wind-farm demonstration case, both for laminar and turbulent background flow conditions. It is shown that wind-farm efficiency can be increased significantly for all considered control cases, and that dynamic yaw control is more effective than dynamic underinduction control for the given wind farm. The turbulent flow cases indicate that dynamic yaw control outperforms simple wake redirection through static yaw control. Further, the fact that the optimizer harnesses non-trivial flow features, e.g. the curling of wakes originating from yawed turbines, justifies the application of high-fidelity models in deriving control strategies, even for relatively simple laminar flows. 

Suggestions for future work include the application of the proposed methodology to larger wind farms or different wind-farm layouts, for which possible interaction between turbine columns could potentially reduce the benefits of yaw-based wake redirection control. Further, incorporating a structural dynamics solver into the framework is required to asses whether the derived control strategies contribute to additional fatigue loading, and would allow to perform a multi-objective optimization in which structural loading and power extraction are balanced.
